Hi I am @rgmelvin (Rich Melvin)
Doctorate in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of New South Wales
Studying genetics and organism life history traits associated with diet and mitochondrial bioenergetics.
Developed a large set of statistical analysis skills and applied them to a wide variety of problems in the biological sciences.
Recently I developed 'Melvin's Index', a method of interpretting wastewater SARS-CoV-2 qPCR testing results to track COVID-19 across large geographical areas.
Interested in the financial industry and wish to translate my skills of experiment design and data analysis by learning financial analysis technology.
Enrolled in the University of Minnesota's FinTech Boot Camp to redirect my knowledge toward thinking about finance.
Specifically interested in hands-on learning of FinTech. 
Collaborations that advance my FinTech skills are welcome and I always love a good set of biological science data :)
